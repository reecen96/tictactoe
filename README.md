&#x2694; <h1>**Tic-Tac-Toe** </h1>&#x2694;
My project incorporates HTML, CSS, JS & Jquery to create an interactive
game of tic-tac-toe. The project involves the mechanics & rules of tic tac toe, game scoring,
timing, different board sized, animations, interactive menus, local storage and computer controlled players.

&#x2694;**How it was built**
My project was built using HTML, CSS, JS & Jquery. Other external media applications
were also used to create pixel graphics and animations.

&#x2694;**How to play / Features**
The application starts on a menu page giving the options to either play a game, game stats or multiplayer.
Game stats retrieves data stored on local storage - the number of times each player has one and the total number of user clicks on the document. The multiplayer option links to a Firebase version on the project which can be used by multiple users simultaneously- similar to a multiplayer feature.

If the Play game option is chosen you are able to play tic-tac-toe and the number of games each player has won is tracked at the bottom right of the screen. Each time an action is made there is an animation at the bottom of the screen. On the bottom left of the screen you are able to chose a Computer opponent (easy, medium or hard), chose the game square size (options are between 3x3 & 9x9) or play a timed game with the computer or another player.


&#x2694;**Known Bugs**
-Graphical popping (when the page loads different images load at different speeds)
-Medium Opponent (computer player) can occasionally break the game
-the timer can stop working

&#x2694;**Future feature / Wishlist**
- Networked multiplayer
- Minimax pc player
- Update visuals (css tinkering)
